# API-Test - Bank User

Four tests are performed in this repository, using the API [mockapi](https://mockapi.io/projects).

- Only one [end point](https://mockapi.io/projects/637bd29d72f3ce38ea95f585) was used to perform all the tests. 

### - Test 1
Verify the Endpoint is empty (If it has any data use the DELETE request to clean and leave it empty)

### - Test 2
Initialize the POJO with 10 random data.  Also, make a code verification for avoiding duplicate email accounts. Then, perform the POST request.

### - Test 3
Make the GET request, asserting that there are not duplicate email accounts.

### - Test 4
Add a test to update an existing AccountNumber





## Set up üöÄ
_These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your premises for development and testing purposes._
__IMPORTANT__: This project was built with version 8 of Java, so try to have the same version to ensure that it works perfectly

1. Clona the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JoanZorovich/API-Test---Final-Exercise.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the suite tests




## Considerations

### - Test 1 EmptyEndpointTest
Make sure that the API has less than 30 users created. If the endpoint has data from many users, this could display a 429 status

### - Test 2 PostUsersTest
For this test, an integer data type called userAmount was created, with the value 10, this according to the test requirement

If desired, this value can be modified to create more users.

### - Test 3 DuplicateEmailAccountsTest
NA

### - Test 4 UpdateAccountNumberTest
The user whose account number is going to be changed is chosen randomly, in the same way, if desired, you can indicate the user on whom you want to change the account number.
